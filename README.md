# ITCR Survey and software Infrastructuer Analysis Results

This repo contains results from two main analyses:
1)Evaluation of the ITCR survey about software evaluation
2)Evaluation of manually currated data from Andrey Ivanov about ITCR and 
the Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTDÂ²) Network tools. This was paired with information about citations to better understand the impact of infastructure that supports software evaluation and citations. However, we note that citations are not always the best metric for understanding software impact.



The original survey analysis is in a private repo to keep the responses anonymous.

See here for the software infastrucure results: [https://hutchdatascience.org/ITCR_tool_char_analysis](https://hutchdatascience.org/ITCR_tool_char_analysis)


Several people were involved with these analyses including Andrey Ivanov (who helped with data collection), Awan Afiaz (who performed most of the analysis), Jeff Leek (who helped with the general direction), and Carrie Wright (who oversaw the analysis, designed the survey with the assitance of the ITCR OPEN group, and performed analyses).
